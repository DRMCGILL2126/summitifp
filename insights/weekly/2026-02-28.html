<ul>

<li>The Communication Services and Utilities sectors led the charge, rising 2.3% and 2.2%, respectively, while the Energy sector also saw a notable gain of 1.4% due to rising oil prices tied to Iran tensions.
<li>The escalating tensions with Iran had a significant impact on the market, with Trump's warnings of potential force contributing to a rise in oil prices and affecting the Energy sector and airline industry, including United's stock.
<li>The 10-year bond yield fell below 4% despite a hot inflation report, due to stagflation risk, and the Medicare trust fund is now expected to run out of money 12 years earlier than expected, which could have significant implications for the Healthcare sector.

<p>As I reflect on the market action for the week ending February 28, 2026, it's clear that investors had to navigate a complex landscape of geopolitical tensions, economic data, and technological advancements. The major indices posted modest gains, with the S&P 500 rising 0.5%, the Dow Jones up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq leading the way with a 1.0% increase. The S&P MidCap 400 and the Russell 2000 also saw gains, while the S&P 500 Growth index was the lone decliner, slipping 0.1%.</p>

<p>The sector performance was quite telling, with Communication Services and Utilities leading the charge, up 2.3% and 2.2%, respectively. The Energy sector also saw a notable gain of 1.4%, likely tied to the rising oil prices due to Iran tensions. The news headlines played a significant role in shaping the market action, with stories like "Any chance the Fed cuts rates this year is ‘evaporating before our very eyes’ as Iran tensions raise oil prices" and "Trump warns ‘sometimes you have to’ use force on Friday. Oil markets now see high odds of a U.S. strike on Iran" contributing to the sector's move. The Financials sector also had a solid week, up 1.4%, possibly due to the "fintech stocks are loved by analysts and could bounce back in a big way" story.</p>

<p>The biggest stories of the week were undoubtedly the escalating tensions with Iran, the impact of AI on the job market, and the Warner Bros. deal. The Iran situation dominated the headlines, with Trump's warnings of potential force and the subsequent rise in oil prices. This had a direct impact on the Energy sector, as well as the airline industry, with United's stock taking a hit due to rising oil prices. The AI story, on the other hand, was more nuanced, with the "fear of becoming obsolete" narrative weighing on the Technology sector, which only managed a 0.2% gain. The Warner Bros. deal, meanwhile, had a mixed impact, with some winners and losers emerging in the media landscape.</p>

<p>Notable company-specific moves included Nvidia's stock struggling due to increased competition, and Palantir's stock receiving an upgrade, with its valuation now less of a "struggle". The bond market also did something unusual, despite a hot inflation report, with the 10-year yield falling below 4% on stagflation risk. Additionally, the Medicare news, which will run out of money 12 years earlier than expected, could have significant implications for the Healthcare sector.</p>
