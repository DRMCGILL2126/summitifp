<p>This week, the major indices ended on a positive note, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones up 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively. The Nasdaq outperformed, rising 1.0% for the period. A closer look at the sector performance reveals that Communication Services and Utilities led the pack, with gains of 2.3% and 2.2%, respectively. This is likely due to the rotation into more defensive sectors as investors reacted to the geopolitical tensions and rising oil prices. The news of a potential US strike on Iran, as reported by MarketWatch, likely contributed to the increase in oil prices, which in turn boosted the Energy sector by 1.4%.</p>

<p>The top news headlines this week were dominated by stories related to geopolitics, AI, and company-specific news. One of the biggest stories was the warning by Trump about the potential use of force, which increased the odds of a US strike on Iran and led to a surge in oil prices. This had a ripple effect on the airline stocks, with United's stock and other airline shares experiencing a reality check. Additionally, the blacklisting of Anthropic by Trump opened the door to Elon Musk and xAI, which could have significant implications for the tech industry. The news of Block's big job cuts due to AI also stoked further AI fears, leading to a decline in software stocks.</p>

<p>The sector performance this week was largely driven by these news events. The outperformance of the Utilities and Communication Services sectors can be attributed to their defensive nature, which makes them more attractive to investors during times of uncertainty. On the other hand, the Technology sector lagged, with a gain of only 0.2%, likely due to the AI-related concerns and the decline in software stocks. Notable company-specific moves included the upgrade of Palantir's stock, which saw its valuation become less of a concern, and the tumble of FanDuel parent's stock due to its struggles in the market.</p>

<p>The bond market also experienced some unusual activity, with the 10-year yield falling below 4% on stagflation risk following a hot producer prices reading. This, combined with the wholesale prices rising sharply and pointing to persistent inflation, suggests that the market is becoming increasingly concerned about the potential for stagflation. The Medicare news, which reported that the program will run out of money 12 years earlier than expected, also adds to the uncertainty and concern about the overall economic outlook.</p>
