<p>As I reflect on the week ending February 27, 2026, I notice that the major indices had a mixed performance. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% for the period, while the Dow Jones was down 1.7%. The Nasdaq, on the other hand, had a stronger showing, up 0.9% for the week. The Russell 2000 was down 1.0%, indicating some caution in the market. Overall, it was a relatively calm week, but with some notable moves in specific sectors and stocks.</p>

<p>The top-performing sectors for the week were Energy, Utilities, and Communication Services, with gains of 3.1%, 2.8%, and 2.6%, respectively. The Energy sector's strong performance can be attributed to the jump in oil prices, which may be reflecting worries about Iran delays on a nuclear deal, as mentioned in a MarketWatch article. The Utilities sector's gain could be due to its traditional role as a safe haven in times of market uncertainty. The Communication Services sector's performance was likely driven by the significant investment in OpenAI by Amazon, Nvidia, and Softbank, which highlights the growing importance of artificial intelligence in the industry.</p>

<p>One of the biggest stories of the week was the significant investment in OpenAI by Amazon, Nvidia, and Softbank, totaling $110 billion. This move raises the stakes for AI monetization and could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry. Another notable story was the sharp rise in wholesale prices, which points to persistent inflation. This could be a concern for investors, as it may lead to higher interest rates and impact the overall economy. Finally, the news about Block cutting over 4,000 jobs due to AI implementation sparked a debate about the impact of technology on employment.</p>

<p>Some notable company-specific moves tied to news events include Dell's stock soaring after record earnings, which signal the company is managing memory shortages well. On the other hand, Duolingo's stock sank after the company announced changes to contend with the threat of AI. Warner Bros. Discovery's bid for Paramount put Netflix in the hot seat, highlighting the intense competition in the streaming industry.</p>

<p>The Financials sector was the worst performer of the week, down 2.1%. This could be due to concerns about bank loans and the warning from a top B. of A. strategist to beware of banks "breaking bad." The Technology sector was also down, albeit slightly, at 0.4%. This could be attributed to the mixed earnings reports from tech companies and the ongoing debate about the impact of AI on employment.</p>
