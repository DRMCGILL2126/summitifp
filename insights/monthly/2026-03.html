          <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended the month with gains of 0.5% and 1.0%, respectively, while the Dow Jones trailed with a 0.3% increase.</li>
<li>Communication Services and Utilities were the top-performing sectors, with increases of 2.3% and 2.2%, respectively, driven by various market trends and news headlines.</li>
<li>The conflict with Iran led to a 1.4% gain in the Energy sector, and also benefited related sectors like Industrials and Materials, while the Technology sector only managed a 0.2% gain due to concerns over AI's impact.</li>
<li>The S&P 500 Value index outperformed its Growth counterpart, with a 1.2% gain versus a 0.1% decline, potentially indicating a rotation towards more defensive sectors.</li>
</ul>
        </div>
<p>As we closed out the month, I took a step back to assess the market's performance, and it's clear that the overall trend was slightly positive. The S&P 500, a broad benchmark of the US stock market, ended the month up 0.5%, while the Nasdaq, which is heavily weighted towards technology stocks, led the charge with a 1.0% gain. The Dow Jones, often seen as a proxy for the broader market, trailed slightly, rising 0.3%. When we look at the sector level, it's interesting to see which areas drove the gains. Communication Services and Utilities took the top spots, with increases of 2.3% and 2.2%, respectively.</p>

<p>So, what drove these moves? As I scanned the news headlines from the past month, a few key themes emerged. The conflict with Iran was a major story, with multiple attacks and retaliations making headlines. This led to a surge in oil prices, with some analysts warning that we could see $100 oil if the situation escalates. As a result, the Energy sector saw a 1.4% gain, while related sectors like Industrials and Materials also benefited. Meanwhile, the drone warfare and potential disruption to air travel had a mixed impact on the market, with some stocks benefiting from the increased tensions, while others suffered.</p>

<p>Another significant story this month was the potential impact of AI on various industries. With JPMorgan warning that up to $150 billion of loans in CLOs face AI risk, it's clear that this is a topic that's on investors' minds. The "fear of becoming obsolete" due to AI, or FOBO, became a real concern for workers and markets alike. As a result, we saw some volatility in the Technology sector, which only managed a 0.2% gain for the month. On the other hand, the Defense sector is likely to see a boost from the increased tensions in the Middle East, with some analysts predicting a long-term increase in defense spending.</p>

<p>In terms of macro themes, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the potential for further escalation are likely to continue shaping the market's direction. The impact of AI on various industries is also a story that's likely to continue unfolding in the coming months. As we look at the broader market, it's worth noting that the S&P 500 Value index outperformed its Growth counterpart, with a 1.2% gain versus a 0.1% decline. This could be a sign that investors are rotating towards more defensive sectors and away from the high-flying growth stocks that have led the market in recent years.</p>

<p>Looking ahead to next month, I'll be keeping a close eye on the situation in the Middle East and its potential impact on oil prices and the broader market. I'll also be watching for further developments in the AI space, as this technology continues to shape and disrupt various industries. As always, it's impossible to predict with certainty how the market will move, but by staying informed and up-to-date on the latest news and trends, we can make more informed decisions and navigate the complexities of the market with confidence.</p>
