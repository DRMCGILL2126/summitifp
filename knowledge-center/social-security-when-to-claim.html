            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Your claiming age permanently affects your benefit amount &mdash; there are no do-overs once you pass the 12-month withdrawal window.</li>
              <li>Delaying benefits from age 62 to age 70 can increase your monthly check by up to 77%.</li>
              <li>A break-even analysis helps determine the optimal claiming strategy for your unique financial situation.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>Few financial decisions carry as much long-term weight as choosing when to start collecting Social Security benefits. The age at which you file permanently determines your monthly benefit for the rest of your life, adjusted only for annual cost-of-living increases. For many retirees, Social Security represents 30% to 50% of their retirement income, which makes this decision one that deserves careful analysis rather than a reflexive choice.</p>

          <p>Understanding how benefits are calculated, how claiming age affects your payment, and what strategies exist for maximizing lifetime income can help you approach this decision with confidence.</p>

          <h2 id="how-benefits-are-calculated">How Social Security Benefits Are Calculated</h2>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) calculates your benefit through a multi-step process. First, your earnings history is adjusted for inflation using national average wage indexing. The SSA then selects your <strong>35 highest-earning years</strong> to compute your Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). If you worked fewer than 35 years, zeros are included for the missing years, which lowers your average.</p>

          <p>Your AIME is then run through a formula to determine your <strong>Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)</strong> &mdash; the monthly benefit you would receive if you claim at your Full Retirement Age (FRA). The PIA formula is progressive, meaning it replaces a higher percentage of income for lower earners. In 2025, the formula replaces 90% of the first $1,174 of AIME, 32% of AIME between $1,174 and $7,078, and 15% of AIME above $7,078.</p>

          <p>Your FRA depends on your birth year. For anyone born in 1960 or later, FRA is 67. If you were born between 1943 and 1954, your FRA is 66. Birth years 1955 through 1959 have FRAs that fall between 66 and 67, increasing by two months for each year.</p>

          <h2 id="claiming-age-comparison">How Claiming Age Affects Your Benefit</h2>

          <p>Claiming before your FRA permanently reduces your benefit. Claiming after your FRA permanently increases it through delayed retirement credits. The table below illustrates the impact of each claiming age, assuming a Full Retirement Age benefit of $2,500 per month.</p>

            </table>
          </div>

          <p>As you can see, the difference between claiming at 62 and 70 is substantial. A person who would receive $1,750 per month at 62 could receive $3,100 per month by waiting until 70 &mdash; a 77% increase. That higher amount then serves as the base for all future cost-of-living adjustments, compounding the advantage over time.</p>

          <h2 id="lifetime-benefit-analysis">Lifetime Benefit Analysis</h2>

          <p>Of course, a higher monthly check does not necessarily mean more total money received over a lifetime. Someone who claims at 62 receives payments for up to eight additional years compared to someone who waits until 70. The break-even analysis below shows estimated total lifetime benefits at different claiming ages, depending on how long you live.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The key insight from this analysis is clear: if you live into your mid-80s or beyond, delaying Social Security generally results in significantly more total income. The break-even point between claiming at 62 versus 67 occurs around age 80. The break-even between claiming at 67 versus 70 occurs around age 82 to 83. With average life expectancy for a 65-year-old now exceeding 84 for men and 87 for women, the odds increasingly favor patience.</p>

          <h2 id="strategies-for-maximizing">Strategies for Maximizing Benefits</h2>

          <p><strong>Delayed Claiming.</strong> The most straightforward strategy is simply to wait. Each year you delay past your FRA, your benefit grows by 8% through delayed retirement credits. This is a guaranteed, inflation-adjusted return that is difficult to replicate in any investment portfolio. If you have the financial resources to cover expenses between retirement and age 70, delaying is often the most powerful move available.</p>

          <p><strong>Bridge Strategies with Savings.</strong> Many people retire before 70 but still want to delay Social Security. A common approach is to use retirement savings &mdash; such as withdrawals from a 401(k) or IRA &mdash; to bridge the income gap. This can be particularly tax-efficient if done in lower-income years before Required Minimum Distributions begin. For example, you might retire at 64, draw from your IRA for six years, and begin Social Security at 70 with the maximum benefit.</p>

          <p><strong>Working While Claiming.</strong> If you claim Social Security before your FRA and continue to work, the earnings test may temporarily reduce your benefits. In 2025, the SSA withholds $1 for every $2 you earn above $22,320. In the year you reach FRA, the threshold is higher and the reduction is less. After reaching FRA, there is no earnings test. It is important to note that benefits withheld due to the earnings test are not lost permanently &mdash; they are factored back into your benefit at FRA. However, the temporary reduction can create cash flow complications that are worth planning around.</p>

          <h2 id="when-early-makes-sense">When Claiming Early Makes Sense</h2>

          <div class="info-box">
            <div class="info-box-title">Situations Where Early Claiming May Be Appropriate</div>
            <p><strong>Health Considerations:</strong> If you have a serious health condition or family history that suggests a shorter-than-average life expectancy, claiming early may result in more total benefits received. The break-even math shifts significantly if life expectancy is below 80.</p>
            <p><strong>Immediate Financial Need:</strong> If you have lost your job, face unexpected expenses, or have no other income sources, claiming Social Security can provide essential financial stability. Avoiding debt or depleting emergency savings may outweigh the benefit of waiting.</p>
            <p><strong>Spousal Strategies:</strong> In some cases, the lower-earning spouse claims early to provide household income while the higher-earning spouse delays to maximize the larger benefit. This strategy also protects the surviving spouse, who will inherit the higher benefit amount.</p>
            <p><strong>Investment Opportunity Cost:</strong> Some financial planners argue that claiming early and investing the benefits could outperform delayed claiming. While this is mathematically possible, it requires consistent above-average investment returns with no guaranteed floor &mdash; a meaningful risk in retirement.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>

          <p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of when to claim Social Security. The optimal strategy depends on your health, financial resources, marital status, tax situation, and retirement goals. However, several guiding principles apply broadly:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>If you are in good health and can afford to wait, delaying benefits &mdash; especially to age 70 &mdash; often produces the highest lifetime income.</li>
            <li>If you are married, coordinate your claiming strategy with your spouse to maximize household and survivor benefits.</li>
            <li>Run a break-even analysis using your actual benefit estimates from the SSA (available at <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ssa.gov/myaccount</a>).</li>
            <li>Consider the tax implications of your decision, including how Social Security income interacts with other retirement income sources.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Taking the time to analyze your options &mdash; ideally with the help of a financial advisor who understands the nuances of Social Security planning &mdash; can mean tens of thousands of dollars in additional lifetime income.</p>
