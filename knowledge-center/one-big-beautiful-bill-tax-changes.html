        <h2 id="what-is-the-obbba">What Is the One Big Beautiful Bill Act?</h2>

        <p>The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was signed into law on July 4, 2025, representing the most significant tax legislation since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017. The bill's primary achievement is making the individual tax provisions of the TCJA permanent. Without this legislation, the lower tax rates, expanded standard deduction, and other individual provisions from the TCJA would have reverted to their pre-2018 levels at the end of 2025.</p>

        <p>Beyond permanence, the OBBBA introduces several new tax benefits and modifies existing ones. For individuals and families, the changes touch nearly every aspect of the tax code &mdash; from how much income is sheltered by the standard deduction to how much you can deduct for state and local taxes. Understanding these provisions is essential for effective financial planning in 2025 and beyond.</p>

        <h2 id="standard-deduction">Increased Standard Deduction</h2>

        <p>One of the most impactful changes for the majority of taxpayers is the increase in the standard deduction. For the 2025 tax year, the standard deduction rises to $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly. These amounts will continue to be indexed for inflation in future years, ensuring the benefit keeps pace with rising costs.</p>

        <p>This increase means that more of your income is sheltered from federal income tax before a single dollar is owed. For most filers &mdash; approximately 90% of taxpayers now use the standard deduction rather than itemizing &mdash; this translates directly into lower taxable income and a smaller tax bill.</p>

        <div class="bar-chart">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 id="senior-deduction">New Senior Standard Deduction</h2>

        <p>The OBBBA introduces a brand-new tax benefit specifically for older Americans. Taxpayers age 65 and older can claim an additional $4,000 standard deduction on top of the regular standard deduction and the existing age-based additional deduction. This means a single filer age 65 or older could have a combined standard deduction well above $20,000.</p>

        <p>However, the senior deduction comes with income phase-outs. It begins phasing out at $75,000 of adjusted gross income for single filers and $150,000 for married couples filing jointly, and is fully eliminated for higher earners. For retirees with moderate incomes, this provision can meaningfully reduce their tax burden.</p>

        <h2 id="key-provisions">Key Provisions Comparison</h2>

        <p>The following table summarizes the major tax provisions before and after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act:</p>

        <div class="kc-table-wrap">

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <h2 id="child-tax-credit">Enhanced Child Tax Credit</h2>

        <p>The child tax credit increases from $2,000 to $2,500 per qualifying child under age 17. This amount will be indexed for inflation going forward, meaning it will gradually increase in future years. The refundable portion of the credit also increases, providing more meaningful support for lower-income families who may not owe enough tax to use the full credit amount.</p>

        <p>For a family with three children, the increase from $2,000 to $2,500 per child represents an additional $1,500 in annual tax savings &mdash; money that can be directed toward education savings, emergency funds, or debt reduction.</p>

        <h2 id="salt-deduction">SALT Deduction Changes</h2>

        <p>The state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap &mdash; one of the most debated provisions of the original TCJA &mdash; has been significantly modified. The cap increases from $10,000 to $40,000, providing meaningful relief to taxpayers in higher-tax states who itemize their deductions.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
          <div class="warning-box-title">SALT Deduction Phase-Out and Sunset</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Phase-out:</strong> The $40,000 SALT cap begins to phase out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income above $600,000. High earners should model the impact carefully, as the phase-out can significantly reduce or eliminate the benefit.</li>
            <li><strong>Sunset provision:</strong> The increased $40,000 cap is temporary. It reverts to the original $10,000 cap after December 31, 2029. This creates a planning window: taxpayers who benefit from the higher cap should consider strategies like accelerating property tax payments or timing income to maximize the deduction while it is available.</li>
            <li><strong>Marriage penalty note:</strong> The $40,000 cap applies per return, not per person. Married couples filing jointly have the same cap as single filers, which continues the marriage penalty aspect of the SALT limitation.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="auto-loan-deduction">Auto Loan Interest Deduction</h2>

        <p>A new deduction allows taxpayers to deduct interest paid on automobile loans, up to $10,000 per year. The vehicle must be assembled in the United States. This deduction phases out for single filers with income above $100,000 and married couples filing jointly above $200,000.</p>

        <p>While this provision primarily benefits middle-income taxpayers with car loans, it represents a meaningful new tax break. On a $35,000 auto loan at 6% interest, a qualifying borrower could deduct approximately $2,000 in interest in the first year, producing a tax savings of $440 to $740 depending on their marginal tax bracket.</p>

        <h2 id="trump-accounts">Trump Accounts</h2>

        <p>The OBBBA also created a new type of tax-advantaged savings account for children, officially known as "Trump Accounts." These custodial accounts allow families to save up to $5,000 per year per child in low-cost U.S. equity index funds, with tax-deferred growth. Children born between 2025 and 2028 may be eligible for a one-time $1,000 government seed contribution.</p>

        <h2 id="qbi-deduction">Qualified Business Income Deduction Made Permanent</h2>

        <p>The Section 199A qualified business income (QBI) deduction, which allows eligible self-employed individuals and pass-through business owners to deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income, has been made permanent. Under the original TCJA, this deduction was scheduled to expire after 2025.</p>

        <p>For small business owners, independent contractors, and anyone earning income through a sole proprietorship, partnership, or S corporation, this permanence provides long-term planning certainty. A business owner earning $200,000 in qualified business income could continue to deduct up to $40,000 annually, meaningfully reducing their effective tax rate.</p>

        <h2 id="financial-planning-implications">What This Means for Your Financial Plan</h2>

        <p>The OBBBA's provisions create both opportunities and planning considerations. Here are the most important implications for your financial strategy:</p>

        <p><strong>Tax bracket certainty.</strong> With the TCJA rates now permanent, you can plan with confidence that the current bracket structure will remain in place. This is particularly valuable for multi-year strategies like Roth conversions, where knowing your future tax rate is essential to making optimal decisions.</p>

        <p><strong>Retirement income planning.</strong> The new senior deduction benefits retirees with moderate incomes. If you are approaching or in retirement, review how the additional $4,000 deduction interacts with your Social Security benefits, pension income, and required minimum distributions.</p>

        <p><strong>Roth conversion opportunity.</strong> The higher standard deduction and senior deduction effectively create more room at the bottom of the tax bracket structure. This can make Roth conversions more attractive, allowing you to convert larger amounts while staying within lower brackets.</p>

        <p><strong>SALT window planning.</strong> If you live in a high-tax state and benefit from the $40,000 SALT cap, remember that it sunsets after 2029. Consider working with your advisor and tax professional to maximize the deduction during this temporary window.</p>

        <p><strong>Business planning stability.</strong> Small business owners can now build long-term plans around the permanent QBI deduction, making it a reliable component of their tax strategy rather than a temporary benefit.</p>

        <p>As with any major tax legislation, the details matter and individual circumstances vary significantly. Working with a financial advisor who understands the interplay between these provisions and your broader financial plan is the best way to ensure you are taking full advantage of the opportunities the OBBBA provides.</p>
