              <li>The taxation thresholds ($25,000/$34,000 for single filers, $32,000/$44,000 for married filing jointly) have not been adjusted for inflation since 1993, pulling more retirees into taxation each year.</li>
              <li>Ohio does not tax Social Security benefits at the state level — a meaningful advantage for Ohio retirees.</li>
              <li>Strategic planning around Roth conversions, withdrawal sequencing, and charitable giving can significantly reduce the tax burden on your benefits.</li>
              <li>The "tax torpedo" zone can cause each additional dollar of income to generate up to $1.85 of taxable income, creating an unusually steep effective marginal tax rate.</li>

          <h2 id="the-basics">The Basics: Yes, Social Security Can Be Taxed</h2>

          <p>Many retirees are surprised to learn that Social Security benefits are not entirely tax-free. Since 1984, a portion of Social Security retirement, survivor, and disability benefits has been subject to federal income tax. The amount that is taxable depends on your total income from all sources — not just your benefit amount.</p>

          <p>Here is the critical point: up to 85% of your Social Security benefits can be included in your taxable income. That does not mean you pay an 85% tax rate on your benefits. It means that up to 85 cents of every dollar you receive in Social Security could be added to the income on which you owe federal tax. The actual tax you pay on that amount depends on your marginal tax bracket.</p>

          <p>Roughly 40% of Social Security recipients currently pay some federal tax on their benefits. However, that percentage has been climbing steadily for decades — and the reason has everything to do with how the thresholds were designed.</p>

          <h2 id="provisional-income">Understanding Provisional Income</h2>

          <p>The IRS does not simply look at your Social Security benefit to determine taxation. Instead, it uses a measure called <strong>provisional income</strong> (sometimes called "combined income"). The formula is:</p>

          <p style="text-align:center; font-size:1.1em; padding:16px 0;"><strong>Provisional Income = Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) + Nontaxable Interest + 50% of Social Security Benefits</strong></p>

          <p>Let's break down each component:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Adjusted Gross Income (AGI):</strong> This includes wages, pension income, IRA and 401(k) withdrawals, capital gains, rental income, dividends, and most other taxable income — but it does not include your Social Security benefits themselves (those are accounted for separately in the formula).</li>
            <li><strong>Nontaxable Interest:</strong> This is primarily interest from municipal bonds. Even though muni bond interest is generally exempt from federal income tax, it still counts toward the provisional income calculation. This catches many retirees off guard.</li>
            <li><strong>50% of Social Security Benefits:</strong> Half of your total annual Social Security benefit is added to the calculation.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Note that Roth IRA distributions are not included in AGI and do not factor into the provisional income calculation — a detail that becomes very important when considering planning strategies.</p>

          <h2 id="taxation-thresholds">The Taxation Thresholds</h2>

          <p>Once you calculate your provisional income, the IRS applies a two-tier system to determine how much of your Social Security is taxable:</p>

          <table class="data-table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Filing Status</th>
                <th>Provisional Income</th>
                <th>Taxable Portion of Benefits</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Single</td>
                <td>Below $25,000</td>
                <td>0%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Single</td>
                <td>$25,000 – $34,000</td>
                <td>Up to 50%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Single</td>
                <td>Above $34,000</td>
                <td>Up to 85%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Married Filing Jointly</td>
                <td>Below $32,000</td>
                <td>0%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Married Filing Jointly</td>
                <td>$32,000 – $44,000</td>
                <td>Up to 50%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Married Filing Jointly</td>
                <td>Above $44,000</td>
                <td>Up to 85%</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>The phrase "up to" is important. The taxable amount is calculated using a specific IRS worksheet, and in many cases retirees in the middle range will have less than the full 50% or 85% included. However, retirees with significant retirement account withdrawals, pensions, or investment income almost always hit the 85% maximum.</p>

          <h2 id="calculation-example">Step-by-Step Calculation Example</h2>

          <p>Let's walk through a concrete example. Consider Linda, a single retiree with the following annual income:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Social Security benefits: $24,000</li>
            <li>Traditional IRA withdrawals: $18,000</li>
            <li>Municipal bond interest: $3,000</li>
            <li>No other income</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Step 1: Calculate provisional income.</strong></p>
          <p>AGI (IRA withdrawals) = $18,000<br>
          Nontaxable interest (muni bonds) = $3,000<br>
          50% of Social Security = $12,000<br>
          <strong>Provisional income = $18,000 + $3,000 + $12,000 = $33,000</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Step 2: Determine the taxable portion.</strong></p>
          <p>Linda's provisional income of $33,000 falls between $25,000 and $34,000 for a single filer, so up to 50% of her benefits may be taxable. The IRS formula for this tier takes the lesser of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>50% of Social Security benefits = $12,000, or</li>
            <li>50% of the amount by which provisional income exceeds $25,000 = 50% × ($33,000 – $25,000) = $4,000</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The lesser amount is $4,000. That means <strong>$4,000 of Linda's $24,000 in Social Security benefits is included in her taxable income</strong>. Combined with her $18,000 IRA withdrawal, her total taxable income before deductions would be $22,000.</p>

          <p>Now suppose Linda had an additional $10,000 in pension income, pushing her provisional income to $43,000 — well above the $34,000 upper threshold. The calculation becomes more complex, but the result is that approximately $16,600 of her $24,000 in benefits would be taxable. That is roughly 69% of her benefits, illustrating how quickly the taxable portion climbs once you cross into the 85% tier.</p>

          <h2 id="ohio-state-taxes">Ohio State Taxes: Good News for Local Retirees</h2>

          <p>If you live in Ohio, there is a significant silver lining: <strong>Ohio does not tax Social Security benefits at the state level</strong>. Your benefits are fully exempt from the Ohio income tax, regardless of your total income.</p>

          <p>This applies to all types of Social Security benefits — retirement, survivor, and disability. Ohio also offers a retirement income credit and a senior citizen credit that can further reduce your state tax burden on other income sources. For retirees in the Akron-Canton area and throughout northeast Ohio, this is a meaningful advantage that makes the state relatively tax-friendly for Social Security recipients.</p>

          <h2 id="states-that-tax-ss">States That Do Tax Social Security</h2>

          <p>While Ohio retirees benefit from full exemption, not every state is as generous. As of 2025, the following states tax Social Security benefits to some degree: Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia. Several of these states have been phasing out or reducing their Social Security taxes in recent years, and the list continues to shrink.</p>

          <p>The remaining 41 states (including Ohio) and the District of Columbia either have no income tax or fully exempt Social Security benefits. If you are considering relocating in retirement, the state tax treatment of Social Security is one important factor — though certainly not the only one — in comparing your overall tax burden.</p>

          <h2 id="tax-torpedo">The "Tax Torpedo" — A Hidden Marginal Rate Spike</h2>

          <p>One of the most misunderstood aspects of Social Security taxation is the so-called <strong>"tax torpedo."</strong> This refers to the income zone where each additional dollar of ordinary income causes more than one dollar of taxable income because it simultaneously pulls more Social Security benefits into the taxable column.</p>

          <p>Here is how it works. In the 50% tier (provisional income between $25,000 and $34,000 for single filers), each additional dollar of income adds $1.50 to your taxable income — $1.00 from the income itself, plus $0.50 of Social Security benefits that become taxable. If you are in the 12% federal bracket, your effective marginal rate in this zone is not 12% but 18% (12% × 1.50).</p>

          <p>In the 85% tier (provisional income between $34,000 and the point where 85% of benefits are fully taxable), each additional dollar of income can add up to $1.85 in taxable income — $1.00 from the income plus $0.85 of newly taxable benefits. In the 22% bracket, your effective marginal rate jumps to over 40% (22% × 1.85 = 40.7%). That is a rate many retirees never see coming.</p>

          <p>The tax torpedo is temporary — once 85% of your benefits are taxable, additional income no longer triggers extra Social Security taxation. But for retirees with moderate incomes, this zone can create a painful spike in effective tax rates that merits careful planning.</p>

          <h2 id="thresholds-not-indexed">The Inflation Problem: Thresholds Frozen Since 1993</h2>

          <p>Perhaps the most consequential detail about Social Security taxation is that the provisional income thresholds — $25,000 and $34,000 for single filers, $32,000 and $44,000 for married filing jointly — <strong>have never been adjusted for inflation since they were established in 1984 and 1993</strong>.</p>

          <p>The original 50% tier thresholds were set in 1984. The 85% tier was added by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Neither set of thresholds has been indexed to inflation, and there is no mechanism requiring Congress to update them.</p>

          <p>To put this in perspective, $25,000 in 1984 is equivalent to roughly $75,000 in today's dollars. The thresholds that were originally intended to tax only upper-income retirees now capture a much larger share of the retiree population. Each year, as wages grow and cost-of-living adjustments increase Social Security benefits, more retirees cross these static thresholds. What was once a tax on the affluent has gradually become a tax on moderate-income retirees — a form of bracket creep that operates in the background without any legislative action.</p>

          <h2 id="strategies">Strategies to Reduce Taxes on Social Security Benefits</h2>

          <p>While you cannot eliminate the taxation rules, thoughtful planning can substantially reduce the amount of Social Security benefits subject to tax. Here are several strategies worth considering:</p>

          <h3>1. Roth Conversions Before Claiming Social Security</h3>
          <p>Converting traditional IRA or 401(k) funds to a Roth IRA in the years before you begin collecting Social Security can be one of the most powerful strategies available. You will pay tax on the conversion amount in the year of the conversion, but once the money is in a Roth account, future withdrawals are tax-free and do not count toward provisional income. By reducing the balance in your traditional accounts, you reduce the required minimum distributions (RMDs) that would otherwise push your provisional income higher.</p>

          <h3>2. Managing Withdrawal Order</h3>
          <p>The sequence in which you draw from different accounts — taxable brokerage accounts, tax-deferred IRAs/401(k)s, and Roth accounts — can have a significant impact on how much of your Social Security is taxed. In years when you need to keep provisional income below a threshold, drawing more from Roth accounts and less from traditional accounts can keep your taxable Social Security in check.</p>

          <h3>3. Municipal Bond Income — A Double-Edged Sword</h3>
          <p>Municipal bond interest is generally free from federal income tax, which makes munis popular with retirees. However, remember that muni bond interest does count toward provisional income. For some retirees, the provisional income effect partially offsets the benefit of the tax exemption. This does not mean you should avoid municipal bonds entirely, but it is important to model the full impact rather than assuming muni income is invisible to the Social Security tax calculation.</p>

          <h3>4. Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)</h3>
          <p>If you are 70&frac12; or older and make charitable donations, a qualified charitable distribution allows you to transfer up to $105,000 per year (2024 limit, indexed for inflation) directly from your IRA to a qualifying charity. The distribution satisfies your RMD but is excluded from your AGI. This directly reduces your provisional income and can keep more of your Social Security benefits from being taxed.</p>

          <h3>5. Timing of Large IRA or 401(k) Withdrawals</h3>
          <p>If you anticipate a year with unusually low income — perhaps a gap year before claiming Social Security or a year with large deductible medical expenses — it may make sense to accelerate IRA withdrawals into that year. Conversely, avoid bunching large withdrawals into years when your Social Security is already being taxed at the 85% level, as the tax torpedo can magnify the cost.</p>

          <h3>6. Delaying or Accelerating Social Security</h3>
          <p>The decision of when to claim Social Security also interacts with the tax picture. Larger benefits (from delaying to age 70) produce higher provisional income, potentially pushing more of the benefit into the taxable range. That does not necessarily mean claiming early is better — the higher benefit amount usually outweighs the additional taxation — but it is a factor that belongs in the analysis.</p>

          <h2 id="widows-tax-penalty">The Widow's Tax Penalty: When Filing Status Changes</h2>

          <p>One of the most overlooked tax consequences in retirement planning involves the shift in filing status after a spouse passes away. When one spouse dies, the surviving spouse typically switches from married filing jointly to single filing status (after the year of death). This change has two painful effects on Social Security taxation:</p>

          <p><strong>First, the provisional income thresholds drop significantly.</strong> The 50% threshold falls from $32,000 to $25,000, and the 85% threshold drops from $44,000 to $34,000. Income that previously kept the couple below the taxable range may now push the surviving spouse well into the 85% tier.</p>

          <p><strong>Second, the surviving spouse often retains much of the same income.</strong> Pension benefits, IRA withdrawals, and investment income may remain similar, while the couple's Social Security is replaced by a single (often higher) survivor benefit. The result is nearly the same income flowing through much tighter thresholds.</p>

          <p>This combination — narrower thresholds with roughly the same income — is known as the <strong>"widow's tax penalty"</strong> or "survivor's tax trap." It can result in the surviving spouse paying a significantly higher effective tax rate than the couple paid together. Planning for this possibility in advance — through strategies like Roth conversions, life insurance, or adjusting asset allocation — can help soften the blow.</p>

          <h2 id="putting-it-together">Putting It All Together</h2>

          <p>Social Security taxation is one of those areas where the rules are straightforward on paper but complex in practice. The interaction between provisional income thresholds, the tax torpedo, frozen thresholds, and filing status changes creates a web of planning considerations that can meaningfully affect your retirement income.</p>

          <p>The key takeaway is that Social Security taxation should not be treated as an afterthought. It deserves attention years before you begin collecting benefits — ideally during the window between retirement and Social Security claiming, when Roth conversions and other strategies can have the greatest impact.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive retirement income plan accounts for these interactions and sequences withdrawals to minimize the lifetime tax burden on your household. Small adjustments in any single year may seem minor, but compounded over a 20- or 30-year retirement, the cumulative tax savings can be substantial.</p>
