          <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

            <li>Inherited retirement accounts now generally must be distributed within 10 years for non-spouse beneficiaries.</li>

        <h2 id="annual-gifting">The Power of Annual Gifting</h2>

        <p>One of the simplest and most effective wealth transfer strategies is also one of the most overlooked: making annual gifts during your lifetime. The federal tax code allows you to give a certain amount each year to any number of recipients without triggering gift tax or reducing your lifetime exemption. This annual gift tax exclusion is a "use it or lose it" opportunity &mdash; the unused portion does not carry forward to the next year.</p>

        <p>Gifting during your lifetime has several advantages beyond the tax mechanics. You get to see the impact of your generosity while you are still alive. You can help your children or grandchildren with a down payment, education costs, or building their own financial foundation at a time when it matters most. And every dollar you give away is a dollar that is no longer in your estate, meaning it will not be subject to estate tax when you pass.</p>

        <p>It is important to distinguish gifts from loans. A true gift has no expectation of repayment. If you lend money to a family member, the IRS expects you to charge at least the Applicable Federal Rate (AFR) of interest. If you charge no interest or below-market interest, the IRS may treat the forgone interest as a gift. When in doubt, document the arrangement clearly and consult with your advisor.</p>

        <h2 id="estate-tax-basics">Federal Estate Tax and the 2025 Sunset</h2>

        <p>The federal estate tax applies to estates that exceed the lifetime exemption amount. In 2025, that exemption is $13.99 million per individual, or effectively $27.98 million for a married couple. Only estates above these thresholds owe federal estate tax, which is levied at a top rate of 40%.</p>

        <p>For most American families, the current exemption means federal estate tax is not a concern. However, this changes dramatically at the end of 2025.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
          <div class="warning-box-title">2025 Sunset Provision: A Major Shift Ahead</div>
          <p>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 roughly doubled the estate tax exemption, but that provision is scheduled to sunset after December 31, 2025. Unless Congress acts, the exemption will drop to approximately $7 million per individual (adjusted for inflation) starting in 2026. This means many families who are currently well below the estate tax threshold could find themselves subject to estate tax. If your estate is in the $7 million to $14 million range, planning in 2025 is especially critical. Strategies like lifetime gifting and irrevocable trusts can lock in the higher exemption before it expires.</p>
        </div>

        <p>State estate taxes are a separate consideration. Ohio eliminated its state estate tax in 2013, so Ohio residents currently face only the federal estate tax. However, if you own property in other states, you may be subject to their estate or inheritance taxes. States like Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Massachusetts have estate tax thresholds significantly lower than the federal exemption.</p>

        <h2 id="wealth-transfer-strategies">Advanced Wealth Transfer Strategies</h2>

        <p>Beyond simple annual gifting, several more sophisticated strategies can help transfer wealth efficiently while minimizing the overall tax burden on your family.</p>

        <p><strong>Gifting during life vs. bequeathing at death.</strong> In general, gifting appreciating assets during your lifetime removes future growth from your estate. However, there is an important trade-off: inherited assets receive a "step-up" in cost basis to their fair market value at the date of death, which can eliminate significant capital gains tax. Gifted assets retain the donor's original cost basis. This means highly appreciated assets may be better left in the estate rather than gifted, depending on the relative impact of estate tax versus capital gains tax.</p>

        <p><strong>Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs).</strong> A GRAT allows you to transfer assets into an irrevocable trust while retaining an annuity payment for a specified term. If the assets grow faster than the IRS-assumed rate (the Section 7520 rate), the excess passes to your beneficiaries gift-tax-free. GRATs are particularly effective in low-interest-rate environments and with assets expected to appreciate significantly.</p>

        <p><strong>Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts (ILITs).</strong> An ILIT holds a life insurance policy outside of your estate, so the death benefit is not subject to estate tax. You make annual gifts to the trust, which the trustee uses to pay premiums. For high-net-worth families, an ILIT can provide liquidity to pay estate taxes or equalize inheritances without increasing the taxable estate.</p>

        <p><strong>Family Limited Liability Companies (LLCs).</strong> A family LLC can hold investments, real estate, or business interests. By gifting minority membership interests, you can take advantage of valuation discounts for lack of marketability and lack of control, effectively transferring more value within the annual exclusion and lifetime exemption limits. These structures require careful legal and tax planning to withstand IRS scrutiny.</p>

        <h2 id="inherited-accounts">Inherited Retirement Accounts: SECURE Act Rules</h2>

        <p>The SECURE Act of 2019 fundamentally changed how inherited retirement accounts are distributed. Understanding these rules is essential for both the account owner planning their legacy and the beneficiaries who will receive the accounts.</p>

        <div class="kc-table-wrap">
          <table class="kc-table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Beneficiary Type</th>
                <th>Distribution Rule</th>

              <tr>
                <td><strong>Surviving Spouse</strong></td>
                <td>Can roll into own IRA, treat as own, or remain as inherited IRA with life expectancy distributions</td>
                <td>Depends on elected method; spousal rollover follows standard RMD rules</td>
                <td>Distributions taxed as ordinary income (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth)</td>
                <td>Most flexible option; spousal rollover allows delay of RMDs until spouse's own RMD age</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Non-Spouse Beneficiary</strong><br>(SECURE Act 10-year rule)</td>
                <td>Must fully distribute the account by December 31 of the 10th year following the year of death</td>
                <td>Yes, if the original owner had already begun RMDs; otherwise no annual RMDs required, just the 10-year deadline</td>
                <td>Distributions taxed as ordinary income (Traditional); can create significant tax spikes if not planned</td>
                <td>Strategic timing of distributions over the 10 years can minimize tax impact; consider beneficiary's own income levels each year</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Eligible Designated Beneficiary</strong><br>(minor child, disabled, chronically ill, not more than 10 years younger)</td>
                <td>Life expectancy distributions (stretch IRA); 10-year rule begins when minor child reaches majority</td>
                <td>Yes, annual RMDs based on beneficiary's life expectancy</td>
                <td>Distributions taxed as ordinary income (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth)</td>
                <td>Minor child exception only applies to children of the decedent, not grandchildren; once child reaches age of majority, the 10-year clock starts</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>The 10-year rule has significant implications for tax planning. A large inherited Traditional IRA that must be distributed within 10 years can push beneficiaries into higher tax brackets, especially during their peak earning years. This is one reason why Roth conversions during the account owner's lifetime can be so valuable: converting to a Roth IRA means beneficiaries still must distribute within 10 years, but the distributions are tax-free.</p>

        <h2 id="charitable-giving">Charitable Giving as a Legacy Tool</h2>

        <p>For many families, leaving a meaningful legacy includes supporting causes and organizations they care about. Several tax-efficient strategies can amplify the impact of charitable giving.</p>

        <p><strong>Donor Advised Funds (DAFs).</strong> A DAF allows you to make an irrevocable charitable contribution, receive an immediate tax deduction, and then recommend grants to specific charities over time. This is particularly useful for "bunching" charitable deductions in high-income years or when you want to separate the tax benefit from the timing of your charitable distributions.</p>

        <p><strong>Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs).</strong> A CRT provides you or your beneficiaries with an income stream for a specified term or for life, with the remainder going to one or more charities. You receive a partial charitable deduction when the trust is established, and the trust itself is exempt from capital gains tax, making it an excellent vehicle for donating highly appreciated assets.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <div class="info-box-title">Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs) Can Satisfy RMDs</div>
          <p>If you are 70&frac12; or older, you can direct up to $105,000 per year (2025 limit) from your Traditional IRA directly to a qualified charity. This Qualified Charitable Distribution counts toward your Required Minimum Distribution but is excluded from your taxable income. For retirees who do not need their full RMD for living expenses, QCDs are one of the most tax-efficient ways to support charitable causes while reducing your tax burden. The distribution never appears as income on your tax return, which can also help keep your Medicare premiums lower and reduce the taxation of Social Security benefits.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="having-the-conversation">Having the Conversation: Why It Matters</h2>

        <p>All the financial and legal strategies in the world cannot replace open, honest communication with your family about your wishes and your wealth. Yet this is the part of legacy planning that people most often skip. Surveys consistently show that the majority of families have never had a meaningful conversation about inheritance, wealth transfer, or the values they want to pass along with their money.</p>

        <p>The consequences of silence can be significant. Heirs who are surprised by an inheritance may be unprepared to manage it. Unequal distributions that made perfect sense to the person who created the plan can cause resentment and family conflict when they are discovered after death. Beneficiaries who do not understand the purpose behind a trust or the conditions attached to it may feel controlled rather than supported.</p>

        <p>Starting the conversation does not require revealing every dollar. It can begin with your values: what role has money played in your life? What do you hope it will mean for the next generation? What responsibilities come with the wealth you are passing along? These conversations set the stage for more specific discussions about the plan itself.</p>

        <p>Consider involving your financial advisor in the conversation. An advisor can provide neutral facilitation, explain complex structures in plain language, and help family members understand the reasoning behind the plan. Some families hold a formal family meeting; others prefer individual conversations over time. There is no single right approach, but having the conversation in some form is far better than leaving everything to be discovered in an attorney's office after you are gone.</p>

        <p>Legacy planning is about more than money. It is about ensuring that the wealth you have spent a lifetime building continues to serve the people and purposes you care about most. With the right combination of financial strategies, legal structures, and family communication, you can create a lasting legacy that reflects your values and protects the people you love.</p>
