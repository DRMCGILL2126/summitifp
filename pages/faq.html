        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Both. Financial planning is included with our investment management service at no additional cost. We believe great investment management requires understanding your full financial picture — goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and more.</p>

          <p>Our advisory fee is 1.25% annually for accounts under $1 million and 1.00% annually for accounts of $1 million or more. Financial planning is included — there is no separate financial planning fee. Fees are billed quarterly based on the average daily balance of your account.</p>

          <p>There are no additional advisory fees, transaction fees, or hidden charges from Summit. The investments we use (primarily low-cost ETFs and index funds) carry their own small expense ratios, which are standard across the industry and not paid to us.</p>

          <p>Our fees are competitive with other independent advisors and significantly more transparent than what you'll find at large wirehouses or broker-dealers. Unlike many firms, financial planning is included at no extra charge, and we never earn commissions or hidden revenue from product sales.</p>
